# Flight Price Prediction using R

##  Project Overview

This project applies **machine learning in R** to predict airline ticket prices based on factors such as departure time, destination, duration, number of stops, and travel class. By leveraging historical flight data, the goal is to uncover pricing patterns and build accurate models that forecast airfare trends.

---

## Background

Flight price prediction is a key challenge in todayâ€™s era of **dynamic pricing**. Airlines use complex algorithms influenced by demand, competition, seasonality, and customer behavior to determine ticket costs. For travelers, price forecasting enables better trip planning and cost optimization, while for airlines, it supports smarter revenue management. With the advancement of data science, predictive modeling offers valuable insights into these fluctuations.

---

## Motivation

Travelers often face frustration when dealing with fluctuating ticket prices, while airlines struggle to balance revenue and customer satisfaction. As frequent travelers, we recognize the logistical and financial challenges caused by unpredictable airfare. This project seeks to close that gap by applying machine learning to make flight pricing more **transparent, predictable, and actionable**. It also demonstrates the practical use of regression models in solving real-world problems.

---

## Problem Statement

The project aims to **develop predictive models** that estimate flight ticket prices using multiple input parameters. By analyzing these variables, the models can help:

* Travelers make smarter, budget-friendly booking decisions.
* Airlines refine and optimize their pricing strategies.

---

## Objectives

* Identify and analyze the factors that influence airline ticket prices.
* Build and train models in R to predict flight fares.
* Compare performance across multiple machine learning models.
* Deliver actionable insights for **both passengers and businesses** to improve decision-making.

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** R
* **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, regression modeling
* **Libraries/Packages:** `caret`, `ggplot2`, `randomForest`, `xgboost`, `dplyr`

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing patterns, trends, and feature correlations.
3. **Model Development** â€“ Applying regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
4. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess accuracy.
5. **Insights** â€“ Recommending strategies for cost-effective travel planning and airline pricing optimization.

---

## Outcomes

* A trained machine learning model capable of predicting flight prices.
* Insights into the most significant factors influencing airfare.
* Comparative analysis of model performance to determine the most reliable approach.

---


## Future Enhancements

* Integrating **real-time flight data APIs**.
* Deploying the model as a **web application** for travelers.
* Expanding analysis with **deep learning models**.
